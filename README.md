## Hey Guys, This is Chris White 😃

- 🏫 Undergraduate majoring in Network Security.
- 💻 New to competitive programming.
- 🎵 I like music, especially classical music and electronic music. By the way, I'm a clarinet player 🎼 and a crazy fan of Hatsune Miku <a href="https://emoji.gg/emoji/2565-miku"><img src="https://cdn3.emoji.gg/emojis/2565-miku.png" width="20px" height="20px" alt="miku"></a>.
- 🏃🏻 A healthy body is the foundation of everything, exercise has helped me a lot in my daily life.
- 🤔 Don't like politics, so please don't talk to me about this, my account only represents myself and doesn't belong to anyone else.
